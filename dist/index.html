                            <h3 class="post-subtitle" id="basic">Basic facts about the long distance hiking trail</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p>The Via Dinarica is a long distance hiking trail of roughly 1.300km in the Balkans. It starts in the woods and caves of <b>Slovenia</b>, leads alongside <b>Croatia's</b> coastline and mountains, runs through vast plains and mountain ranges of <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, winds across <b>Montenegro's</b> peaks and canyons until reaching its end in northern <b>Albania's</b> rough mountains and valleys.</p>
                        <a>
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Is this only for hiking pros and superhumans?</h3></a>
                        <p>I don't think so! When I first discovered the Via Dinarica, I was both intrigued and intimidated. And I must admit, even after I decided to hike it, I was unsure whether I would make it to the end. I had never done such a long hiking trail before, and had never dared to do a longer <b>solo hiking trip</b>, had never been to the Balkans and knew close to nothing about language, history or cultural context in this region.</p>
                        <p>The good news is - spoiler alert - I did it! And it was not only possible, definitely challenging but also a lot of fun! 😊</p>
                        <p>So if you're - like me - wondering whether it's A) possible and B) worth setting out on this adventure, <b>Balkanize Me is for you</b>. I hope you'll find helpful advice, some insights into planning and experiences from the trail I wish I had known before. And, maybe most importantly, the final <b>spark of encouragement</b> to just try it and find out for yourself. You can do this! ✨</p>

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle" id="distance">Time and distance: how long and how far?</h3>
                        <p>The official Via Dinarica White Trail is <b>1,261.2 km</b> long. If you check my tracks, you will notice that I didn't hike every single kilometer of the Via Dinarica as it is marked. I fortunately realized early on that it pays off to <b>be kind to myself</b> instead of stubbornly trying to make things work out according to plan. They rarely ever do, and actually, many a plan B turned out SO much better than what I originally had in mind! Plus, I made a habit of learning from fellow hikers and avoiding their mistakes or hardships. I therefore occasionally bypassed, skipped or made up <b>my own version of some trail stages</b> when I didn't like the official route, when it didn't seem to exist or when the weather got too bad to continue. I also intentionally added extra detours in Montenegro and Albania based on recommendations from local guides. The following figures do not include the miles to and from trailheads before and after rest days.</p>
                        <p>This is my trail summary in kilometers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Total distance hiked: 1,130.8 km</b></li>

                            <h3 class="post-subtitle" id="weather">Weather and season: when to start?</h3>
                            <p>I started in Razdrto, Slovenia at the <b>beginning of August</b> in the scorching sun. I reached Valbone Valley, Albania on the <b>last day of October</b> on a freezing but sunny autumn day. At the beginning, finding enough shade and water were top priorities. Later on, I grew increasingly concerned about the coming winter and I did get stuck in a snowy cold weather front in Montenegro at the beginning of October. This forced me to take a long break which I spent by lake Skader close to the coast. The climate is much milder by the seaside - and the trainride there is an adventure of itself (if you're curious, check out <a href="https://www.seat61.com/belgrade-to-bar-railway.htm">Seat 61's report on the Belgrade to Bar railway</a>)! Fortunately, the first snow in the mountains was not the onset of winter yet. So after 10 long long days of waiting, I was able to carry on and complete my journey all the way to Albania.</p>
                            <p>According to <a href="links.html">other Via Dinarica resources</a>, it is safe to <b>start as early as May or June</b> if you don't want to get stuck in snow fields in the higher mountains. The heat in August was almost unbearable on some stages. My coping strategy is to start early in the morning, take a long siesta somewhere in the shade and then carry on in the afternoon. This rhythm works well as long as the days are long. <b>Finishing in October</b> is already risky as I experienced myself: The days get shorter and the nights are freezing cold. But, as one of my trail angels in Stavna by the Montenegrinian-Albanian border shared with me, October is his favorite month for hiking this area. It's off-season, the trees are colorful and, if you're lucky, you experience a true Indian summer. I agree!</p>
                            <hr class="my-4"/>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle" id="direction">North- or southbound: which way to hike?</h3></a>
                            <p>The Via Dinarica White Trail was designed from north to south. There is no reason not to do it the other way round and I've met some hikers who have done it. I personally recommend to hike <b>from Slovenia to Albania</b> though. In my opinion, the Slovenian part of the trail is quite a gentle start in regards to both the elevation profile and the natural sights. They are beautiful but fairly unspectacular. There is more of a <b>climax when hiking southbound</b> both in terms of higher peaks, lower valleys and in the diversity of nature in general. Every country holds its own natural spectacles though and I wouldn't want to miss any episode.</p>
                            <p>Quite a few hikers I have met or talked to have started in the South with the <a href="http://peaksofthebalkans.com/">Peaks of the Balkans</a> trail before heading onto the Via Dinarica. This is a 192 km hiking trail in the Prokletje mountains winding across the borders of Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro. The final part of the Via Dinarica intersects with the <b>Peaks of the Balkans</b> and you can continue staight onto this trail if you hike southbound. It is a gorgeous area and the trail is very well maintained. I think I would have done it too, had it not been so cold.</p>
                            <hr class="my-4"/>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle" id="tent">Tent and accomodations: where and how to sleep?</h3></a>
                            <p>If you want to hike the whole Via Dinarica, <b>you will need a tent</b>. I loved the flexibility of not having to plan ahead or book anything in advance and there is an abundance of wild campsites on almost every stage of the trail. Plus, you will cross many villages and towns on the trail. Even in small villages, you will find the occasional guesthouse or restaurant which offers rooms. The <b>"sobe" sign</b> is what you'll want to look out for. There is absolutely no need to plan accomodation beforehand if you only need a room occasionally. Locals have always been extremely helpful in finding accomodation when needed. This was true for the entire trail.</p>
                            <p>I paid <b>between 5 and 35 €</b> per overnight stay. This usually includes breakfast (in Montenegro and Albania most places charge extra for hot drinks). If you spend rest days in more touristic places (like Senj, Mostar, Sarajevo, even Žabljak), they are naturally more expensive.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In <b>Slovenia</b>, I only slept in the tent in the wild or in people's gardens or backyards. You pass quite a few villages and usually find friendly people to ask for water.</li>
                                <li>In <b>Croatia</b>, there are some national parks where it is forbidden to camp outside specified areas. In both the Risnjak National Park and the Northern and Southern Velebit National Parks (Sjeverni Velebit and Paklenica), there is an excellent mountain hut infrastructure - this is actually true for the whole Velebit area, even outside the national parks. Many are unstaffed and uncatered, but there are some exceptions. The huts vary from the occasional shady, dirty, run down shack to bright and luxurious cabins with panoramic windows and electric sockets powered by solar panels. I <b>loved the diversity</b> of this. You never know what to expect and in case you don't like the hut, you can always find a campsite nearby. Almost all huts have some <b>source of water</b> (spring or cistern) close by. I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the water wherever I went.</li>
                                <li>In <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b> I also did a lot of wild camping. In the mountainous areas there are quite a few mountain huts as well. Most of them are run by local chapters of the mountaineering association who will lend the keys to groups with advance reservation. This is, of course, not suitable for individual travellers, though there are some exceptions as well as occasional catered huts or bivouac shelters which are open. Plus, I was lucky to come across shelters where other hiking groups invited me to join them.</li>
                                <li>There are plenty of excellent wild camping sites in <b>Montenegro</b> and touristic infrastructure is generally very good (though also more expensive than in Bosnia). My first night in Montenegrinian territory was by Trnovačko lake below mount Maglić. This was the beginning of October and in the morning some parts of the valley were covered with frost. I did not want to repeat such a cold night in the tent and from then on I decided to always look out for accomodation. This meant that I had to plan ahead for the first time since I started my trip and also needed more budget. At the same time, it meant that I almost did not need to carry or prepare any food because most lodgings include quite an abundant dinner and breakfast.</li>
                                <li>The last few days of my trip in <b>Albania</b>, I also booked a room for every night. Again, it would have been possible to camp on every stage of the trip. There were days when it was hard to find lodging since it was so late in the year and many places close after the main season. I almost didn't manage to go through with 2 extra detours a Bosnian guide had recommended to me because it was hard to find accomodation. In the end, my current hosts could usually help, plus Mapy.cz, the app I used for navigation and tracking, provided good and mostly up to date recommendations for accomodation. And finally, if none of these resources worked out, I checked options on Booking.com.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I will write more about <b>finding safe campsites and dealing with uncomfortable situations</b> and share some advice for long distance hiking newbies like I was one myself at some point. Especially for the ladies out there. Let me only state this: Caution and foresight are good companions - and yes, fear will accompany you, too - but it is absolutely possible to do this by yourself. You will get used to the sounds of the forest, you will grow increasingly comfortable with the wilderness and sooner or later you will become an expert in finding safe campsites and calming yourself even in seemingly scary situations. I adjusted and honed my strategies the further I went, you will find and develop your own.</p>

                            <a>
                                <h3 class="post-subtitle" id="money">Cash and currencies: how to pay (and get money) where?</h3>
                            </a>
                            <p><b>Euros</b> are always helpful and accepted almost everywhere.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slovenia's currency is the <b>Euro</b>. If you start in Razdrto, you will most likely take the bus from Postojna and there are several ATMs there. I don't remember any other ATMs on the way, but since its so early on the trail, you shouldn't need them.</li>
                                <li>Croatia's currency is the <b>Croatian Kuna (KN)</b>, to be replaced by the <b>Euro</b> in January 2023. I was surprised to get by with Kuna in Bosnia and Hezegovina up until Hajdučke vrleti Motel by Blidinje lake since this is an area mostly populated by cultural Croatians.</li>
                                <li>From then on, you enter majority Bosniac regions where you will need the <b>Bosnian Convertible Mark (KM)</b> - or Euros (accepted in most places). Jablanica was the next opportunity to withdraw cash (you usually get only KM and no Euros in Bosnia).</li>
                                <li>Even though it is not part of the EU, Montenegro's official currency is also the <b>Euro</b>. In Montenegro there is no ATM close to the trail until you reach Žabljak, so it's good to plan that in.</li>
                                <li>Albania's currency is the <b>Albanian Lek (L)</b>. I did not have any Lek when I arrived (there is no way of withdrawing Lek in the mountains) but there are not many places where you can spend money anyways. I paid most accommodations by card or with Euros and this was no problem.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I usually carried <b>no more than 300 € at a time</b> but I almost ran out of cash three times. Not surprisingly, since ATMs are scarce in the mountains... Which is not a big deal if you have your tent and some food supply. There were weeks when I hardly spent any money. But if the weather gets colder or you are - like me - from time to time craving a nice, hot shower and are looking forward to a comfortable rest day, cash - or a working credit card - are essential. Mapy.cz allows you to <b>search for ATMs</b> in the offline mode which is mostly up to date and proved very helpful (especially when I did not have mobile data or access to WIFI).</p>
                            <p>To all Europeans out there: I learned the hard way that our <b>debit cards (EC cards) only work in EU countries</b>. I didn't realize that until I was well into Bosnia and Herzegovina, was about to run out of cash and could not remember my credit card PIN (I almost never use it). Paypal also required an extra verification, which left me without alternative. So, this advice might seem like a no-brainer, but: Do remember to <b>take a credit card</b> (including the PIN) as well as a debit card. I was glad I had given my mum an authorization to handle my bank affairs so she could order an express new PIN. It arrived just in time on my second day in Mostar where I had spent two beautiful rest days - and did not want to get stuck due to lack of cash and inability to cancel my debts with the landlord…</p>

                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle" id="food">Food and supply: what to take, where to restock?</h3></a>
                            <p>There are <b>many opportunities</b> to restock your supplies on the way. At the beginning, in Slovenia and until the Velebit area in Croatia, you will not go a day or two without passing a village or town with a shop, a restaurant or at least a kiosk.</p>
                            <p>It is wise to restock your supplies for 10-12 days in <b>Senj</b> (off the official trail), as there are no shopping opportunities whatsoever anywhere close to the trail in the Velebit area. You will come across some catered huts or restaurants, though. Use every opportunity to buy a meal! I ran out of snacks (luckily not food in general) but was still quite desperate to reach Gračac. After <b>Gračac</b> the trail leads through more populated areas and it is much easier to access shopping - or other - infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>In Bosnia and Herzegovina there are small supermarkets here and there, except between <b>Jablanica and Tjentište</b>. There are some kiosks by Boračko Jezero, but again, you will find many restaurants or catered bed and breakfasts in Ravna, Rujište and Lukomir.</p>
                            <p>In Montenegro, your supplies need to last until <b>Žabljak</b>. This is quite a touristic hub and an excellent place to do grocery shopping. After this, <b>Mojkovac</b> is the next town with a supermarket. Again, there are guesthouses with excellent food on the way. In Albania you can buy food in Gusinje, Vusanje and there is a tiny kiosk in Theth before you eventually reach Valbone.</p>

                            <p>Access to clean water was among my <b>top concerns</b> before starting out on my journey. In the end, I carried only 3 water-related items:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>a 3 l waterbag with integrated membrane filter</b></li>
                                    <blockquote class="blockquote">I bought the <a href="https://www.katadyngroup.com/int/en/item~p6736">Katadyn Befree</a> water filtration system recommended to me by Sonja and Thomas from <a href="/links.html#gpx">Wurzelkocher blog</a>. On previous hikes, I had used another <a href="https://sourcetacticalgear.com/product/wxp-3l/">waterbag by SOURCE</a>, which is more practical for refilling water from open streams, but has no filtration system.</blockquote>
                                    <li><b>an ordinary 1.5 l plastic water bottle</b></li>
                                    <blockquote class="blockquote">A simple bottle of the type you can find and replace in any kiosk anywhere. The trick is to choose one with an <b>hourglass figure</b> so you can strap it easily to the side of your backpack (to the Germans out there: Ja! Mineralwasser bottles are my favourites - they have the best shape and cost only 0.15 cents).</blockquote>
                                    <li><b>some water purification tablets</b> </li>
                                    <blockquote class="blockquote">I took around 40 <a href="https://www.katadyngroup.com/int/en/8014258-katadyn-micropur-forte-mf-1t-dccna-de-e-f-nl-it-~p6707">Mikropur Forte tablets</a>. My worst case scenario (right after being attacked by a bear or kidnapped and raped by some random vicious stranger) was having to drink contaminated water even after treatment with purification tablets. I am SO glad I didn't need a single one! They were essential for my psychological well-being, though. With them, I had a safe emergency plan in my pocket (even if it was an extremely unpleasant one).
                                    </blockquote>
                                </ol>
                                This equipment allowed me to carry <b>up to 4.5 l of water</b> at a time. I only ever needed this on very hot days when I was uncertain about refilling opportunities. I prefer skipping a meal if this means that I have to carry less weight for half a day and replenish my reserves whenever I'm close to a water source or in a village.
                            </p>
                            <p>A word about gear: As you will notice on my <a href="/links.html#gear">gear list</a>, I like to keep things simple. I met two other hikers in the first third of my trip (one hiking north-, one hiking southbound) who were both convinced that it's impossible to get by without a sturdy 4 m rope and a bucket to draw water from wells. I did not carry either of them, was temporarily VERY worried, but got by just fine. While I do think that it makes sense to invest in high quality equipment for some <a href="/links.html#gear">essential gear</a>, it's absolutely impossible to prepare for all the possible emergencies on the way. <b>Improvisation and asking for help</b> will take you a long way. Carrying a simple spare plastic bottle and skipping a meal here and there are two examples of a more pragmatic, minimalist approach which worked very well for me. And while I was very sceptical about drawing water from cisterns at the beginning, I grew increasingly comfortable throughout the trip and didn't even filter most of the water towards the end.</p>
                            <p><b>Access to clean water varies</b> a lot on the trail, depending on where you're at. You will find many water sources accurately marked on the maps and many helpful comments by other hikers on the individual trail stages in the <a href="/links.html#gpx">Via Dinarica App</a>. Early on in Slovenia, there are plenty of <b>villages</b> on the way where I asked locals to refill my bottles (I usually did not only get water but also an invitation for a meal or a bag full of home grown tomatoes or other delicacies). For the rest of the trip, especially the more remote areas, I found that the cisterns, wells and springs proved to be excellent. Even in abandoned villages or village houses which only serve as holiday homes, you will find many wells which are not locked. Almost every <b>mountain hut</b> has some kind of water point close by. Some catered huts have only limited water resources or purification systems which are not officially safe to drink, but absolutely fine (unless you have a very sensitive stomach). You can usually <b>buy bottled water</b> or other drinks there. To me, it's a great way of supporting the local infrastructure and I seized every opportunity to buy a drink which I did not have to carry for miles. In Bosnia and Herzegovina I found that my maps were slightly less accurate than in Croatia and therefore it was a bit harder to predict the existence and accessibility of water sources along the way. But in the regions with a Muslim majority, there are many <b>public water fountains</b> on the streets or by crossroads dedicated to loved ones or local figures. And lastly, <b>cemetaries and mosques</b> always have a source of water close by.</p>

                            <p>I owe the name for this page to a comment to Samer, one of my trail angels, a local hiking guide and mountain lover from Sarajevo. We met on a very memorable day well into my trip in the heart of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
                            <p>His team is operating the mountain hut Dom Vrela where I stopped briefly after a night in the stunning spaceship disguised as a bivouac shelter by Mount Vito. I had hardly met any other hikers on the trail since my departure from Jablanica several days before and the two previous hiking days had been gorgeous, but extremely exhausting. It was such a welcome break and helped me recharge not only my physical but also my social energy levels. I shared stories from my trail, the many beautiful encounters and overwhelming hospitality I experienced - as well as the many frustrating detours I had found myself on. He took some time to explain one of my most recent involuntary deviations to me, shared excellent advice on tour alternatives in Montenegro and offered me a lift back to the trailhead thus sparing me from a good 3 km of nasty asphalt roads. On the way, he told me that he meets many travelers who come to the Balkans for the first time in their lives and who keep coming back: once, and again, and again. <b>"We say they have been balkanized"</b>, he smiled. At that point I realized that this is exactly what had happened to me - and, what the Via Dinarica seems to be doing to anyone who dares to venture onto this intriguing trail.</p>
