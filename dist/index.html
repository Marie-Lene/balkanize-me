                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Basic facts about the long distance hiking trail</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p>The Via Dinarica is a long distance hiking trail of roughly 1.300km in the Balkans. It starts in the woods and caves of <b>Slovenia</b>, leads alongside <b>Croatia's</b> coastline and mountains, runs through vast plains and mountain ranges of <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, winds across <b>Montenegro's</b> high peaks and steep canyons until reaching its end in northern <b>Albania's</b> rugged mountains and valleys.</p>
                        <a>
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Is this only for hiking pros and superhumans?</h3></a>
                        <p>I don't think so! When I first discovered the Via Dinarica, I was both intrigued and intimidated. And I must admit, even after I decided to hike it, I was unsure whether I would make it to the end. I had never done such a long hiking trail before, and - being a woman - had never dared to do a longer <b>solo hiking trip</b>, had never been to the Balkans and knew close to nothing about language, history or cultural context in this region.</p>
                        <p>The good news is - spoiler alert - I did it! And it was not only possible, definitely challenging but also a lot of fun! 😊</p>
                        <p>So if you're - like me - wondering whether it's A) possible and B) worth setting out on this adventure, <b>Balkanize Me is for you</b>. I hope you'll find helpful advice, some insights into planning and experiences from the trail I wish I had known before. And, maybe most importantly, the final <b>spark of encouragement</b> to just try it and find out for yourself. You can do this! ✨</p>
                        </br>
                        <a>
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Time and distance: how long and how far?</h3>
                        <p>The official Via Dinarica White Trail is <b>1,261.2 km</b> long. If you check my tracks, you will notice that I didn't hike every single kilometer of the Via Dinarica as it is marked. I fortunately realized early on that it pays off to <b>be kind to myself</b> instead of stubbornly forcing things to go according to plan. They almost never do, and actually, many a plan B turned out SO much better than what I originally had in mind! Plus, I made it a habit to learn from fellow hikers and avoid their mistakes or hardships. I therefore made up <b>my own version of some trail stages</b> where I didn't like the original route and occasionally bypassed or skipped episodes when it made sense to me or the weather got too bad to continue. The following figures do not include the miles to and from trailheads before and after rest days.</p>
                        <p>This is my trail summary in kilometers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Total distance hiked: 1,130.8 km</b></li>
                                <li>Other transportation: 259.2 km</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hitchhiking: 138.9 km</li>
                                    <li>Train: 66.4 km</li>
                                    <li>Bus: 48.7 km</li>
                                    <li>Taxi: 5.2 km</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>Total distance travelled: 1,390.8 km</b></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is how much time I spent on the trail:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Total hiking days: 58 days</b></li>
                                <li>Extra non-hiking days: 25 days</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rest days due to bad weather: 13 days</li>
                                    <li>Rest days for resting purposes: 7 days</li>
                                    <li>Rest days due to illness: 3 days</li>
                                    <li>Getting to and back from the trail: 2 days</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>Total days on tour: 83 days</b></li>
                            </ul>
                        </br>
                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Weather and season: when to start?</h3>
                            <p>I started in Razdrto, Slovenia at the <b>beginning of August</b> in the scorching sun. I reached Valbone Valley, Albania on the <b>last day of October</b> on a freezing but sunny autumn day. In between, I grew increasingly concerned about the coming winter and I did get stuck in a snowy cold weather front in Montenegro at the beginning of October. This forced me to take a long break which I spent by lake Skader close to the coast. The climate is much milder by the seaside - and the trainride there is an adventure of itself! Fortunately, the first snow in the mountains was not the onset of winter yet. So after 10 long days of waiting, I was able to carry on and complete my journey all the way to Valbone, Albania.</p>
                            <p>According to <a href="links.html">other Via Dinarica resources</a>, it is safe to <b>start as early as May or June</b> if you don't want to get stuck in snow fields in the higher mountains. <b>Finishing in October</b> is already risky as I experienced myself, the days get shorter and it really gets cold in the nights. But, as one of my trail angels in Stavna by the Montenegrinian-Albanian border shared with me, October is his favorite month for hiking this area. It's off-season, the trees are colorful and, if you're lucky, you experience a true Indian summer. I agree!</p>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle">Hiking north- or southbound: which way to choose?</h3></a>
                            <p>The Via Dinarica White Trail was designed from north to south. There is no reason not to do it the other way round and I've met some hikers who have done it. Personally, I would recommend to hike <b>from Slovenia to Albania</b> though. In my opinion, the Slovenian part of the trail is quite a gentle start in regards to both elevation profile and natural sights. There is more of a <b>climax when hiking southbound</b> both in terms of higher peaks, lower valleys and in the diversity of nature in general. Every country holds its own natural spectacles though and I wouldn't want to miss any episode.</p>
                            <p>Quite a few hikers I have met or talked to have started in the South with the <a href="http://peaksofthebalkans.com/">Peaks of the Balkans</a> trail before heading onto the Via Dinarica. This trail is a 192 km signposted trail in the Prokletje mountains in the border area between Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro. The final part of the Via Dinarica intersects with this trail and it is also possible to continue staight onto the Peaks of the Balkans if you hike south-bound. I think I would have done it too, had the weather not been so cold.</p>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle">Tent and accomodations: where and how to sleep?</h3></a>
                            <p>If you want to hike the whole Via Dinarica, <b>you will need a tent</b>. I loved the flexibility of not having to plan ahead or book anything in advance and there is an abundance of wild campsites on almost every stage of the trail. Plus, you will cross many villages and towns on the trail. Even in small villages, you will find the occasional bed & breakfast or restaurant which offers rooms. The <b>"sobe" sign</b> is what you'll want to look out for. Don't plan too much though. Locals have always been extremely helpful in finding accomodation when needed. This was true for the whole of the trail.</p>
                            <p>An overnight stay usually costs <b>between 5 and 35 €</b> per night and usually includes breakfast (in Montenegro and Albania most places charge extra for hot drinks). If you spend rest days in more touristic places (like Senj, Mostar, Sarajevo) they are naturally more expensive.</p>
                            <p>In <b>Slovenia</b>, I only slept in the tent in the wild or in people's gardens or backyards. You pass quite a few villages and usually find friendly people to ask for water.</p>
                            <p>In <b>Croatia</b>, there are some national parks where it is forbidden to camp outside specified areas. In both the Risnjak National Park and the Northern and Southern Velebit National Parks (Sjeverni Velebit and Paklenica), there is an excellent mountain hut infrastructure - this is actually true for the whole Velebit area (not all of is is part of the national parks). Many are unstaffed and uncatered, but there are some exceptions. The huts vary from the occasional shady run down shack with dirt and mice to extraordinary 5 star cabins with panoramic windows and electric sockets powered by solar panels (though mice usually like these, too...). I <b>loved the diversity</b> of this. You never know what to expect and in case you don't like the hut, you can always find a campsite nearby. Almost all huts have some <b>source of water</b> (spring or cistern) close by. I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of the water wherever I went.</p>
                            <p>In <b>Bosnia and Heregovina</b> I also did a lot of wild camping. In the mountainous areas, there are quite a few mountain huts as well, but most of them are run by local chapters of the mountaineering association who will lend the keys to groups with advance reservation. This is, of course, not suitable for individual travellers, though there are some exceptions as well as occasional catered huts or bivouac shelters which are open. Plus, chances are you're lucky to come across other groups who will invite you to join them.</p>
                            <p>My first night in <b>Montenegro</b> by Trnovačko lake below Maglić was extremely cold and in the morning some parts of the valley were covered with frost. This was the beginning of October. From then on I decided to always look out for accomodation. This meant that I had to plan ahead for the first time since I started my trip. It also requires more budget but it also meant that I almost did not need to carry or prepare food because most lodgings include quite an abundant dinner and breakfast. There are plenty of excellent wild camping sites in Montenegro, though, and touristic infrastructure is very good (though also more expensive than in Bosnia).</p>
                            <p>The last few days of my trip in <b>Albania</b>, I also always booked a room but again, it is possible to find excellent camping sites wherever you go. There were days when it was hard to find lodging since it was so late in the year and many places close after the main season. My current hosts could usually help, plus Mapy.cz, the app I used for navigation and tracking, provided good and mostly up to date recommendations for accomodation. And finally, if none of these resources worked out, I checked options on Booking.com.</p>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle">Money, money, money: cash, currencies and ATMs</h3></a>
                            <p><b>Euros</b> are always helpful and accepted almost everywhere.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slovenia's currency is the <b>Euro</b>. I don't remember any ATMs on the way, but since its so early on the trail, you won't need them.</li>
                                <li>Croatia's currency is the <b>Croatian Kuna (KN)</b>, to be replaced by the <b>Euro</b> in January 2023. I was surprised to get by with Kuna in Bosnia and Hezegovina up until Hajdučke vrleti Motel by Blidinje lake since this is an area mostly populated by cultural Croatians.</li>
                                <li>From then on, you enter majority Bosniac regions where you will need the <b>Bosnian Convertible Mark (KM)</b> - or Euros (accepted in most places).</li>
                                <li>Montenegro's official currency is also the <b>Euro</b> even though it is not part of the EU. In Montenegro there is no ATM close to the trail until you reach Žabljak, so it's good to plan that in.</li>
                                <li>Albania's currency is the <b>Albanian Lek (L)</b>. I did not have any Lek when I arrived (there is no way of withdrawing Lek in the mountains) but there are not many places where you can spend money anyways. I paid most accommodations by card or with Euros and this was no problem.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I usually carried <b>no more than 300 € at a time</b> but I almost ran out of cash three times. Which is not a big problem on the trail if you have your tent and some food supply. There were weeks when I almost spent no money at all. But if the weather gets colder or you are - like me - from time to time craving a nice, hot shower and are looking forward to a comfortable rest day, cash - or a working credit card - are essential. Mapy.cz has a functionality to <b>search for ATMs</b> in the offline mode which is mostly up to date and proved to be very helpful (especially without mobile data).</p>
                            <p>To all Europeans out there: I learned the hard way that our <b>debit cards (EC cards) only work in EU countries</b>. I didn't realize that until I was well into Bosnia and Herzegovina, was about to run out of cash and could not remember my credit card PIN (I almost never use it). So, this advice might seem like a no-brainer, but: Do remember to <b>take a credit card</b> (including the PIN) as well as a debit card. I was glad I had given my mum an authorization to handle my bank affairs so she could order an express new PIN. It arrived just in time for me to pay my debts to the hostel in Mostar where I had spent two beautiful rest days - and did not want to get stuck due to lack of cash and inability to cancel my debts with the landlord…</p>
                            <a><h3 class="post-subtitle">Food and supply: what to take, where to restock?</h3></a>
                            <p>There are many opportunities to restock your supplies on the way. At the beginning, in Slovenia and until the Velebit area in Croatia, you will not go a day or two without passing a village or town with a shop, a restaurant or at least a kiosk.</p>
                            <p>It is wise to restock your supplies for 10-12 days in <b>Senj</b> (off the official trail), as the Velebit area has no shopping opportunity whatsoever. You will come across some catered huts or restaurants, though. Use every opportunity to get cooked food! :) I ran out of snacks (luckily not food in general) but was still quite desperate to reach Gračac. After <b>Gračac</b> you'll be in more populated areas or at least cross more infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>In Bosnia you find small supermarkets here and there, except between <b>Jablanica and Tjentište</b>. There are some kiosks by Boračko Jezero, but again, you will find many restaurants or lodging with catering in Ravna, Rujište and Lukomir.</p>
                            <p>In Montenegro your supplies need to last until <b>Žabljak</b>. This is quite a touristic hub and an excellent place to shop for groceries. After this, <b>Mojkovac</b> is the next town with a supermarket. And again, there are bed and breakfasts, hostels and hotels with excellent food on the way. In Albania you can buy food in Gusinje, Vusanje and there is a tiny kiosk in Theth before you eventually reach Valbone.</p>
