                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Basic facts about the long distance hiking trail</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p>The Via Dinarica is a long distance hiking trail of roughly 1.300km in the Balkans. It starts in the woods of <b>Slovenia</b>, leads across <b>Croatia's</b> mountains and along its coastline, runs through vast plains and mountain ranges of <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, across high peaks and steep canyons of <b>Montenegro</b> until reaching its end in northern <b>Albania's</b> rugged mountain ranges and valleys. When I first discovered it, I was both intrigued and intimidated.</p>
                        <p>I must admit, even after I decided to hike it, I was unsure whether I would make it to the end. I had never done such a long hiking trail before, and - being a woman - had never dared to do a <b>solo hiking trip</b>, had never been to the Balkans and knew close to nothing about language, history or cultural context in this region.</p>
                        <p>The good news is - spoiler alert - I did it! ðŸ˜Š And it was not only possible, definitely challenging but also a lot of fun!</p>
                        <p>So if you're - like me - wondering whether it's A) possible and B) worth setting out on this adventure, <b>Balkanize Me is for you</b>. I hope you'll find helpful advice, some insights into planning and experiences from life on the trail I wish I had known before. And, maybe most importantly, the final <b>spark of encouragement</b> to just try it and find out for yourself. You can do this! âœ¨</p>

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Time and distance: how long and how far?</h3>
                        <p>The official Via Dinarica trail is 1,261.2 km long. If you check my trail, you will notice that I didn't hike every single kilometer of the Via Dinarica as it is marked. I fortunately realized early on that it pays off to <b>be kind to myself</b> instead of stubbornly forcing things to go according to plan. They never do and actually, many plans B turned out SO much better from what I originally had in mind! Plus, I made it a habit to learn from fellow hikers and avoid their mistakes or hardships. I therefore made up <b>my own version of the trail</b> where I didn't like the original route and occasionally bypassed or skipped episodes when it made sense to me or the weather got too bad to continue.</p>
                        <p>This is my trail summary in kilometers:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Total distance hiked: 1,130.8 km</b></li>
                                <li>Other transportation: 259.2 km</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hitchhiking: 138.9 km</li>
                                    <li>Train: 66.4 km</li>
                                    <li>Bus: 48.7 km</li>
                                    <li>Taxi: 5.2 km</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>Total distance travelled: 1,390.8 km</b></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is how much time I spent on the trail:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Total hiking days: 58 days</b></li>
                                <li>Extra non-hiking days: 25 days</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rest days due to bad weather: 13 days</li>
                                    <li>Rest days for resting purposes: 7 days</li>
                                    <li>Rest days due to illness: 3 days</li>
                                    <li>Getting to and back from the trail: 2 days</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>Total days on tour: 83 days</b></li>
                            </ul>
                        </br>
                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Weather and season: when to start?</h3>
                            <p>I started in Razdrto, Slovenia at the <b>beginning of August</b> in the scorching sun. I reached Valbone Valley, Albania on the <b>last day of October</b> on a freezing but sunny autumn day. In between, I grew increasingly concerned about the coming winter and I did get stuck in a snowy cold weather front in Montenegro at the beginning of October. This forced me to take a long break which I spent by lake Skader close to the coast. The climate is much milder by the seaside - and the trainride there is an adventure of itself! Fortunately, the first snow in the mountains was not the onset of winter yet. So after 10 long days of waiting, I was able to carry on and complete my journey all the way to Valbone, Albania.</p>
                            <p>According to <a href="links.html">other Via Dinarica resources</a>, it is safe to <b>start as early as June</b> if you don't want to get stuck in snow fields in the higher mountains. <b>Finishing in October</b> is already risky as I experienced myself, but as one of my trail angels in Stavna by the Montenegrinian-Albanian border shared with me, October is his favorite month for hiking this area. It's off-season, the trees are colored and, if you're lucky, you experience a true Indian summer. I agree!</p>
