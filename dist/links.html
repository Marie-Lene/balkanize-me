                            <p>I was so glad to find some <b>trail reports</b> online which not only fueled my curiosity but also made it seem feasible for me to set out on this adventure. I devoured everything I could find but found it quite hard to get <b>reliable up-to-date information</b>. Here's the list of resources I found most helpful:</p>
                        
                            <h2 class="section-heading">üó∫Ô∏è Via Dinarica GPX tracks üß≠</h2>
                        </br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://www.wurzelkocher.ch/abenteuer/via-dinarica-2020/" target="blank">Wurzelkocher</a></li>
                                <p>I am particularly grateful to Sonja and Thomas who shared their experience of hiking the Via Dinarica in 2020 on their <a href="https://www.wurzelkocher.ch/abenteuer/via-dinarica-2020/" target="blank">German-language hiking blog Wurzelkocher</a>. I don't think I would have dared to start my journey without their <b>example, GPX tracks and many fun and encouraging stories</b>. They went back in 2021 and share recommendations about alternatives to the less enjoyable stages. Highly recommended!</p>
                                <li><a href="https://trail.viadinarica.com/en/tour/long-distance-hiking-trail/via-dinarica-white-trail/17291189/" target="blank">The official Via Dinarica White Trail website and app</a></li>
                                <p>This is of course a super helpful resource, expecially the <b>GPX tracks and the comments of fellow hikers</b>. There are quite a few <b>caveats to the official route</b> as you can read in the comments to the individual stages. Nevertheless, it's a great baseline.</p> 
                                <blockquote class="blockquote">I was initially quite confused that there are 2 different starting points in Slovenia and subsequently also divergent routes to Sne≈ænik mountain. This depends on whether you follow the <b>single consecutive GPX track</b> you find in the Via Dinarica app or download the <b>45 individual stages</b> (the Slovenian part is contained in this <a href="https://trail.viadinarica.com/en/tour/long-distance-hiking-trail/via-dinarica-slovenia-from-nanos-to-babno-polje-/17236133/" target="blank">1st stage</a>). I was very happy with my decision to start in Razdrto and not from Postojna as this seems to be the trail which is being maintained. The Slovenian section has been updated and marked freshly as of summer 2021, so you will find even more updates and variations on the way - and, according to a lovely lady from <a href="https://www.bikeslovenia.si/sl/" target="blank">Bike Slovenia</a> I met on the trail, less gravel roads and more enjoyable trails and highlights on the new route.</blockquote>

                                <p>Samson Clyde aka <a href="https://superhiphikes.wordpress.com/via-dinarica/" target="blank">Superhip</a> is another Via Dinarica hiker from 2019 who shared his <b>GPX tracks with helpful waypoints</b>. I only discovered this after my trip but wish I had known it before! üòÖ He also made a <b>beautiful video</b> with impressions from his Via Dinarica thru-hike.</p>

                                <p>This Czech hiker also hiked the Via Dinarica in 2020 and shares his <b>GPX tracks, gear list</b> and some insights on his <a href="https://fkalab.wordpress.com/" target="blank">Czech wordpress site</a>.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As you notice, my main concern is <b>sharing GPS coordinates</b> as reliable navigation really is the biggest challenge on the trail. While many sections are marked very well and are easy to follow, there are countless other sections where you have no clue where you're going. If you compare 5 tracks, you are likely to get 5 trail variations - and nature or humans may have changed the circumstances on the ground in the meantime. <b>So be prepared to get lost - and find your way over and over again!</b></p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">üèïÔ∏è My gear list ü•æ</h2>
                        <p>What gear do you need to do a Via Dinarica thru-hike? Well, that depends. I invested in <b>some essentials</b> as I had previously usually hiked in the company of well-equipped friends. üòâ However, I did NOT spend a fortune and was absolutely <b>happy with my choice of gear</b>. I am convinced that it is not necessary to own the latest, most expensive light-weight outdoor gear available. I was also extremely thankful and surprised that nothing broke - and even my <b>trail running shoes</b> lasted the whole trail (they were predicted to tear after 1,000 km max). The only thing I had to resupply over and over again were socks! I lost count on how many pairs I went through! üòÉ</p>
                        <p>I once read that if you want to travel light, don't ask: <b>"What do I need to take with me?"</b> Instead ask yourself: <b>"What can I leave behind?"</b> I find this to be very wise and would encourage you to consider what you think you need, weigh your gear and then iterate on it until you're happy with the weight. I was very glad to be travelling light! And trust me, there's <b>plenty of stores, supply opportunities and, most importantly, helpful people</b> on the way. Not everywhere, of course, but usually within a day or two of hiking or within a few hours of hitchhiking!</p>
                        <p>I hope my list provides some guidance and orientation. Let me know if you have questions about specific items!</p>
